            The purpose of
            <a href="https://picture-app-1cbee.web.app/">this</a> project was to
            become familiar with Firebase, React, and Redux. <br /><br />
            The app stores pictures in a common cloud server.<br /><br />
            This was my first project completely developed from front to back.

            <br /><br />
            This <a href="https://livingatlas.netlify.app">website</a> was made
            to bring Patrick Bergsma’s vision to life: to have an accessible,
            storytelling tool that would answer questions about the Bible and
            display them in a map. <br /><br />
            Living Atlas won #1 Project in North America, and

            Macro Meals is a mobile application proposal for the RICE 2022
            Business Plan Competition.
            <br /><br />
            This app is intended to effortlessly document recipes and track
            their nutritional information, to then help enterprises and
            individuals achieve a variety of goals including: health plans, meal
            plan distribution, creative cooking, progress tracking, trend
            observation, menu generation, and community interaction. You can see
            our prototype
            <a href="https://susccrua.github.io/macro/">here</a> .<br /><br />
            Macro meals will be developed using Flutter.
