            This website was made to bring Patrick Bergsma’s vision to life: to
            have an accessible, storytelling tool that would answer questions
            about the Bible and display them in a map. <br /><br />
            Living Atlas won #1 Project in North America, and #1 Project for
            Viability.

            The purpose of this project was to become familiar with Firebase,
            React, and Redux.
            <br /><br />
            The app stores pictures in a common cloud server.<br /><br />
            This was my first project completely developed from front to back.
